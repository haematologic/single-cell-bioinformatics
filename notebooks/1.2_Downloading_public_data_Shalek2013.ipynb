    "4. [`scipy`](http://www.scipy.org/) - (pronounced \"sigh-pie\") \"Scientific Python\" - Contains statistical methods and calculations\n",
    "4. [`seaborn`](http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html) - Statistical plotting library. To be completely honest, R's plotting and graphics capabilities are much better than Python's. However, Python is a really nice langauge to learn and use, it's very memory efficient, can be parallized well, and has a very robust machine learning library, `scikit-learn`, which has a very nice and consistent interface. So this is Python's answer to `ggplot2` (very popular R library for plotting) to try and make plotting in Python nicer looking and to make statistical plots easier to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll read in the data using `pandas` and look at the first 5 rows of the dataframe with the dataframe-specific function `.head()`. Whenever I read a new table or modify a dataframe, I **ALWAYS** look at it to make sure it was correctly imported and read in, and I want you to get into the same habit."
